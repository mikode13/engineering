# MiKode Engineering

MiKode Engineering is the source of truth for cross-project engineering decisions,
standards, reusable documentation templates, and shared development practices.

It documents decisions and policies; it does not contain the production implementation of
MiKode libraries or applications. Reusable tooling belongs in its own package repository.

## Who should use this repository

MiKode maintainers, contributors, and project teams should use these documents when they
start a project, make a cross-project technical decision, or need to apply an existing
standard consistently.

## Documents

### Architecture Decision Records

ADRs preserve the reasoning behind significant decisions. They are historical records and
should not be rewritten to hide the trade-offs of an earlier decision.

See the [ADR index](adr/README.md).

### Standards

Standards describe the current rules for MiKode projects. A standard is active when its
status says `Active`.

See the [standards index](standards/README.md).

### Templates

Templates provide reusable starting files with explicit placeholders. A copied template
must be completed and validated in the target repository before it becomes effective.

See the [templates index](templates/README.md).

## Current standards and decisions

Accepted decisions and their active standards:

- [ADR 0001: Use Prettier for cross-project code formatting](adr/0001-use-prettier.md)
- [ADR 0002: Use the Commons Clause with the MIT License for source-available software](adr/0002-use-commons-clause-with-mit.md)
- [Code formatting standard](standards/code-formatting.md)
- [Licensing standard](standards/licensing.md)

Proposed decisions and their draft standards:

- [ADR 0003: Use pnpm as the package manager](adr/0003-use-pnpm.md)
- [ADR 0004: Support Node.js 22 and later](adr/0004-support-node-22-and-later.md)
- [ADR 0005: Use a strict shared TypeScript configuration via @mikode/tsconfig](adr/0005-use-strict-shared-typescript-configuration.md)
- [ADR 0006: Use ESLint with a shared @mikode/code-quality configuration](adr/0006-use-eslint-via-code-quality-package.md)
- [Package management standard](standards/package-management.md)
- [Node.js version standard](standards/nodejs-version.md)
- [TypeScript standard](standards/typescript.md)
- [Code quality standard](standards/code-quality.md)

## Documenting a new decision

Before adding a decision, confirm that it affects more than one MiKode project. Describe
the problem and constraints, research realistic alternatives, and record the proposed
decision in an ADR. Once the decision is confirmed, mark the ADR `Accepted`, update the
related standard, add or update a template when needed, and update the indexes.

Use relative links for documents in this repository and authoritative links for external
facts. Keep historical reasoning in ADRs and active rules in standards.
