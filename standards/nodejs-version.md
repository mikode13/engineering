# Node.js version standard

- Status: Draft
- Last reviewed: 2026-07-24

## Scope

This standard applies to all MiKode repositories that run on Node.js, including
libraries published to a registry and applications deployed as services or tools.

## Rules

Projects adopting this standard MUST:

1. Support Node.js 22.13 and later LTS lines; published packages MUST NOT require APIs
   unavailable in Node.js 22.
2. Declare the supported range in the `package.json` `engines` field.
3. Pin the development version with an `.nvmrc` file at the repository root.
4. Run CI on Node.js 24, and SHOULD also run the test suite on Node.js 22 for published
   packages so the declared floor is actually verified.
5. Treat raising the minimum version of a published package as a breaking change.

Projects SHOULD review the minimum version when the Node.js release schedule changes
(a line reaching end of life or entering LTS, typically each April and October).

## Required configuration

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "^22.13.0 || ^24.0.0"
  }
}
```

The range explicitly lists the LTS lines MiKode supports. A new release line is added
only after it enters LTS and passes CI; Node.js 26 is expected to be added when it
enters LTS in October 2026. Extending the range requires a package release — the
accepted cost of not claiming support for untested runtimes.

`.nvmrc`:

```text
24
```

The major-only value lets version managers (nvm, fnm, and compatible tools) select the
latest installed 24.x release with `nvm use` or automatic directory switching.

## Exceptions

A project MAY require a newer minimum when it needs an API not available in Node.js 22.
The project MUST document the reason in its README and reflect it in `engines` and
`.nvmrc`. A project targeting a constrained platform (for example, a serverless runtime
pinned by a provider) MAY pin differently and MUST document the constraint.

## Adoption

New projects copy the configuration above before their first commit that runs code.
Existing projects add `engines` and `.nvmrc` together and verify the test suite passes
on the declared floor before publishing under it.
