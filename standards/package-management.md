# Package management standard

- Status: Draft
- Last reviewed: 2026-07-24

## Scope

This standard applies to all MiKode JavaScript and TypeScript repositories that install
npm-registry dependencies.

## Rules

Projects adopting this standard MUST:

1. Use pnpm for installing dependencies and running package scripts.
2. Pin the exact pnpm version in the `package.json` `packageManager` field.
3. Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` and keep it in sync with `package.json`.
4. Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI so builds fail when the lockfile is out of
   date instead of silently resolving different versions.
5. Use pnpm commands in scripts, documentation, and contributor instructions.
6. Keep pnpm's default of not running dependency lifecycle scripts. When a dependency
   legitimately needs its install scripts (typically native modules), allow that
   specific dependency in the `allowBuilds` map in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and treat the
   entry as a reviewable change.
7. Include a `preinstall` guard so that running npm or Yarn in the repository fails
   immediately instead of creating a foreign lockfile.

Projects MUST NOT:

- Mix package managers in one repository: no `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or Bun
  lockfiles, and no npm, Yarn, or Bun commands in scripts, CI, or documentation.
- Enable `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` or otherwise re-enable dependency lifecycle
  scripts globally; install-time script execution stays opt-in per dependency.
- Depend on Corepack. Corepack is not distributed with Node.js 25 and later, so no
  script, CI step, or documented setup path may assume it is present.

Developers SHOULD install pnpm explicitly with one of the
[documented installation methods](https://pnpm.io/installation); once installed, pnpm
reads the `packageManager` field and switches to the pinned version itself. A developer
MAY use Corepack on their own machine to provision pnpm, provided the project works
without it.

## Required configuration

`package.json` MUST contain a pinned pnpm version and the package-manager guard:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@11.17.0",
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm"
  }
}
```

The version is an exact version, not a range. Renovate-style tooling or a deliberate
manual update changes it; individual developers do not need matching global installs
because pnpm defers to the pinned version.

The CI install step is:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

When a dependency needs its install scripts, allow it explicitly in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm 11 removed the earlier `onlyBuiltDependencies` family of
settings and no longer reads the `pnpm` field in `package.json`):

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
allowBuilds:
  sharp: true
```

## Exceptions

A project MAY use a different package manager only when an external platform requires it
(for example, a deployment target that only supports npm). The project MUST document the
exception and its reason in its README.

## Adoption

New projects start with `pnpm init` and the configuration above. Existing projects with
another lockfile migrate with `pnpm import`, which converts the existing lockfile, then
delete the old lockfile in the same change.
